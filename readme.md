# Wordpress Terraform Solution Project version 1.1
### Date October 9, 2024
 

# Introduction
To create a Terraform solution that provisions an EC2 instance to serve as a WordPress webserver with a MySQL database, we will need to use various AWS resources. This solution will include an EC2 instance, a MySQL RDS database, security groups, and necessary IAM roles.

# Assumptions
- The instance will be in a public subnet for internet access.
- The RDS database will be in a private subnet for security.
- The security group will allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH access to the EC2 instance.
- The EC2 instance will run WordPress using Apache, PHP, and connect to the RDS MySQL database

# Terraform Configuration
The Terraform configuration will include the following resources:
- AWS provider configuration
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Internet Gateway and Route Table for public subnet
- NAT Gateway and Route Table for private subnet
- Security Groups for EC2 instance and RDS database
- IAM roles for EC2 instance
- EC2 instance with user data script to install WordPress
- RDS MySQL database

# Terraform Commands
To create the infrastructure using Terraform, you can run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

# Terraform Setup
To set up Terraform for this project, you will need to install Terraform on your local machine and configure the AWS provider with your credentials. You can follow the official Terraform documentation for installation and setup instructions.

# Key Challenges

## Ubuntu AMI Changes

- Ubuntu AMI Data Source: Finding the correct Ubuntu AMI for the EC2 instance can be challenging due to the region and availability. You can use the AWS CLI to find the latest Ubuntu AMI for your region.
- Updated Ami Attribute: The AMI attribute may change over time, so you need to update the AMI ID in the Terraform configuration to use the latest AMI for the Ubuntu instance.
- Updated user data script: The user data script for installing WordPress may need to be updated based on the latest WordPress version and dependencies. You can use the official WordPress installation guide for reference.

## Shared EBS Volume

- EBS Volume: This creates a 10 GB EBS volume and attaches it to the EC2 instance for storing WordPress files and data. You can modify the volume size based on your requirements.
- EBS Volume Attachment: The EBS volume is attached to the EC2 instance using the `aws_volume_attachment` resource in Terraform. You can specify the device name and mount point for the volume.
- Mounting the Volume: After attaching the EBS volume, you need to mount the volume to the EC2 instance and configure WordPress to use the volume for storing files and data.

This setup enables both EC2 instances to share an EBS volume, which could be useful for data storage purposes. However, take care with concurrent writes to the volume from both instancesâ€”consider using a higher-level shared storage solution like Amazon EFS if that's required.
